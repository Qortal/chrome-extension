# Qortal Extension - chromium-based browser extension for Qortal

The Qortal Extension is a chromium-based browser version of the Qortal Trifecta series of interfaces. Allowing installation to any chromium-based browser (Brave, Opera, Chrome, and many more...) allowing integration with web 2.0 applications, access to Q-Apps with authentication through gateway nodes, and much more. 

The Qortal Extension opens the door for 'legacy web applications' to be able to interact with Qortal, and for users to be able to utilize Q-Apps via 'gateway nodes' such as those on https://qortal.link and https://qortal.name. 

Much more information will be coming soon, and existing details and assistance can be found on https://qortal.dev
